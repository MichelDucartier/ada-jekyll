## Introduction 

In the movie industry, creativity is generally considered to be a key factor in the success of a film. Actors often need to reinvent themselves to keep audiences hooked, but do they really ? Some actors tend to develop a comfort zone and keep playing the same type of movies/characters. Our projects aims at discovering those comfort zones, when they are created and what happens when actors step out of it. Conversly, we also want to evaluate if a given role/character tends to be played only by a subset of actors and which feature(s) these actors share, which could lead us to uncover racial or gender biases in film castings. We build on top of the results of the [original paper](http://www.cs.CMU.edu/~ark/personas/) in order to identify in a more fine-grained approach if an actors exhibit a recurring persona accross the characters they play.
